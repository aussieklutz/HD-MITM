## Short Version

* Download and install the Arduino IDE, and open it at least once.
* If using Windows, [first install the Freetronics Windows Drivers](http://www.freetronics.com/pages/installing-the-usb-driver-file-for-windows)
* Click the "Download ZIP" button on the right-hand side of this page, which will download the file LeoStickBoardProfile-master.zip.
* Find the "Arduino" directory in your Documents (or "My Documents") directory. This will have been created the first time you launched the Arduino IDE.
